# Poker

**Short Description:**  
An application that simulates a card game where the player can deal cards from a deck and determine the highest card of the round. The interface displays the current number of cards in the deck, the round result, and a visualization of the dealt cards.
The main goal of the project is to demonstrate working with data arrays (deck of cards), generating random numbers (card dealing), and visualizing the game logic through a simple and intuitive interface.

## 🚀 Technologies

- **Frontend:** React
- **Additional:** TypeScript, OOP

## 📋 Features  

The application allows determining the result of a poker round based on the dealing of five cards from a standard deck. It also tracks the number of cards dealt from the deck. The application provides the ability to deal cards and restart the game once it is finished.
